# ConvexHull
C++ implementation of Graham's scan algorithm to compute the convex hull of a set of points in the xy-plane. 

Remarks:

1.- The algorithm uses an incremental approach. 

2.- It computes the upper and lower convex hull of a set of points. 

3.- Time complexity: O(nlog(n))

4.- Space complexity: O(n)
